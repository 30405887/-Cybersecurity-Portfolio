# ITECH1502 - Cybersecurity Portfolio Final Project  
**Student:** Bernie Ybanez  
**Student ID:** 30405887  
**Project Title:** Investigating Red Stealer ‚Äî Threat Intelligence & Malware Analysis (SOC Lab)  

---

##  Summary
In this lab, I investigated a suspicious executable as part of a SOC-style threat-intel lab, starting from its SHA256 (`248FCC901AF‚Ä¶68F907B`) and enriching the sample with vendor metadata, sandbox summaries, and network artefacts from tools like **VirusTotal** and **MalwareBazaar**.  

By combining static and dynamic analysis, I extracted actionable Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), identified malware family aliases, and mapped observed behaviours to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques.  

The sample was classified as a **Trojan / Information Stealer** linked to the **RedLine / RecordStealer** family and was observed under several filenames, including `Wextract.EXE`, `malicious.exe`, and `red.exe`.  

Key findings include:
- **First-seen timestamp:** 2023-10-06 04:41:50 UTC  
- **C2 endpoint:** 77.91.124.55:1971  
- **MITRE Technique:** T1005 ‚Äì Data from Local System  
- **Privilege manipulation APIs:** ADVAPI32.dll imports (e.g., `AdjustTokenPrivileges`, `OpenProcessToken`)  

The final deliverable includes:
- IOC Table  
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping  
- Example YARA and Sigma Rules  
- Containment and Remediation Recommendations  

This project reinforced **NIST CSF** functions ‚Äî *Identify, Detect, Respond* ‚Äî and strengthened my ability to produce operational intelligence for SOC and IR teams.

##  Introduction
**Portfolio Link:** `30405887/cyber-portfolio-Bernie-Ybanez-30405887`  
**Hands-on Platform:** [CyberDefenders ‚Äì Red Stealer Lab](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/red-stealer/)  

**Why Selected:**  
This lab simulates a real-world SOC threat intelligence workflow analysing a suspicious binary/hash, extracting IOCs, identifying C2 infrastructure, and producing operational guidance for Incident Response. It directly complements learning outcomes in incident response, threat intelligence, and digital forensics.

---

##  Problem / Challenge
A suspicious executable was discovered on an endpoint and suspected to be part of a **C2-enabled information-stealer campaign**.  

As a Threat Intelligence Analyst within the SOC, my tasks were to:
- Analyse the file hash and classify the malware  
- Identify malware family and IOCs  
- Determine C2 endpoints and communication behaviour  
- Map behaviours to MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
- Produce actionable intelligence for SOC and IR teams  

---

##  Project Goals / Objectives
- Use VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar to classify the sample and gather metadata  
- Perform safe static analysis (hashing, strings, import table) and review sandbox summaries  
- Extract IOCs and map behaviours to MITRE ATT&CK  
- Propose containment, remediation, and detection rules (YARA/Sigma)  
- Reflect on lessons learned and professional development

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  

### Step 1 ‚Äì Input & Initial Enrichment  
Queried **VirusTotal** using the SHA-256 hash to obtain vendor detection labels, metadata, and sandbox behaviour summaries.  

### Step 2 ‚Äì Determine Malware Category  
Reviewed AV vendor tags such as *Trojan*, *RedLine*, and *Stealer*. Sandbox confirmed data collection and C2 communication.  

### Step 3 ‚Äì Identify Filenames  
Extracted from VirusTotal metadata: `Wextract.EXE`, `malicious.exe`, `red.exe`.  

### Step 4 ‚Äì Establish First Submission Timestamp  
First uploaded: **2023-10-06 04:41:50 UTC**  

### Step 5 ‚Äì Map Behaviour to MITRE ATT&CK  
Behaviours observed:
- File and registry access  
- Browser data scraping  
- Credential harvesting  
- Local file collection  

Mapped to:
- **T1005** ‚Äì Data from Local System  
- **T1071.001** ‚Äì Web Protocols  

### Step 6 ‚Äì Identify Domain Name Resolution  
Detected DNS queries to `facebook.com` ‚Äî likely used to mimic legitimate traffic.  

### Step 7 ‚Äì Extract C2 IP and Port  
Decoded C2 endpoint: **77.91.124.55:1971** with **bot ID "frant"**.  

### Step 8 ‚Äì Locate YARA Rule and Author  
Found rule: `detect_Redline_Stealer` by **Varp0s** in MalwareBazaar.  

### Step 9 ‚Äì Correlate Aliases via Malpedia  
Confirmed **RecordStealer** as alias for **RedLine Stealer**.  

### Step 10 ‚Äì Determine Imported DLLs and Privilege Escalation APIs  
Detected `ADVAPI32.dll` functions:
- `AdjustTokenPrivileges`  
- `OpenProcessToken`  
- `LookupPrivilegeValueA`  

Indicates potential privilege escalation attempts.
